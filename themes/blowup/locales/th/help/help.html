  <p>Modifying Blowup theme configuration enables you to customize your theme very easily. To do so, simply fill in the configuration fields or choose a predefined style.</p>
  <h4>Predefined styles</h4>
  <p>You can choose a predefined style in the <strong>Predefined styles</strong> drop-down list. Once you have chosen the style, you have to submit the form to apply the modifications.</p>
  <p>You may then modify the predefined style according to your taste and needs.</p>
  <h4>Colors</h4>
  <p>When you have to enter a color value, you should use the hexadecimal format. For example: <code>#FF0000</code> will give you red. You may also use the color picker located next to every color field.</p>
  <p>If you lack inspiration, try and visit the following pages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors">Color code list</a> (Wikipedia)</li>
    <li><a href="http://kuler.adobe.com/">Adobe Kuler</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://colorblender.com/">ColorBlender</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.colorcombos.com/">ColorCombos</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Measurement units</h4>
  <p>When you have to indicate a size, it must be followed by a measurement unit. For example: <code>1em</code>. If you do not include the unit, pixels will be used as default measurement unit.</p>
  <p>The following measurement units are available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>px</li>
    <li>em</li>
    <li>ex</li>
    <li>pt</li>
    <li>%</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Header images</h4>
  <p>You can choose a header image among the list to replace the default one.</p>
  <p>By choosing <strong>Custom...</strong> in the image list, you will be able to upload your own image. <strong>The image file must be in JPG or PNG format and must be precisely 800px wide.</strong>
    <p>If you upload a JPG image, a border will be added to the image, which is not the case with PNG images (the transparency of which will also be kept).</p>
    <h4>Configuration import and export</h4>
    <p>At the bottom of the page, you can display an area called <strong>Configuration import/export</strong>. This text area contains the configuration you are currently using. You can copy it to share it with others.</p>
    <p>To apply (import) a configuration, you simply need to replace the content of the text area with the configuration you want to use. Don't forget to click on <strong>Apply code</strong>.</p>
