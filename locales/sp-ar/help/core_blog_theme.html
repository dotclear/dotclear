<h4>Installed themes</h4>
<p>The list of installed themes appears in this tab. You can select a theme by clicking on it and pressing <strong>Use this one</strong>.</p>
<p>The currently selected theme can be modified using the <strong>Edit theme files</strong> button. If the selected theme includes a theme editor, it can be easily personalized using the <strong>Configure theme</strong> button.</p>
<p>You can also deactivate a theme (for instance if you have compatibilities issues with it). A <strong>Deactivated themes</strong> tab will appear containing the list of these.</p>

<h4>Add themes</h4>
<p>This tab allows you to browse the DotAddict themes repository either by alphabetical order, either by searching using the dedicated field. The themes that are already installed do not appear in the list.</p>

<h4>Install or upgrade manually</h4>
<p>If the theme you want to install (or upgrade) is not in the DotAddict repository, you can install it either by uploading it from your hard drive, either by entering its installation URL. A theme is always packaged as a zip file.</p>
