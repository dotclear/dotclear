  <h4>Installed plugins</h4>
  <p>Each line starts with the plugin logo you will find in the menu (on the left of your screen).</p>
  <p>A Dotclear logo next to the action buttons indicates that the plugin comes directly with Dotclear and is one of its components.</p>
  <h3>Activated plugins</h3>
  <p>This list displays information about activated plugins: Name, version, short description. Two actions are possible: <strong>Deactivate</strong> (temporary operation) or <strong>Delete</strong> (permanent operation).</p>
  <h3>Deactivated plugins</h3>
  <p>This list shows the plugins that have been deactivated by the user. For each one, two actions are possible: <strong>Activate</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> (permanent operation).</p>
  <h4>Add plugins</h4>

  <p>Two search methods are available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>By typing the plugin name in the <em>Search in repository</em> field,
    <li>By browsing the index</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the index, unfolding a plugin by clicking on the arrow next to its name will allow you to access its DotAddict page or to go to a support website if the plugin author picked one.</p>
