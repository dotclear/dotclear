  <h4>IP Filter</h4>
  <p>This filter allows you to manually blacklist or whitelist IP addresses. A comment coming from an IP address listed in the black list section will immediately be considered as junk. A comment coming from an IP address listed in the white list section will be considered as trusted and the other antispam filters won't process it.</p>
  <p>To add an IP, first select the tab you want (<strong>Blacklist</strong> or <strong>Whitelist</strong>) and enter the IP address. The <strong>Global IP</strong> checkbox is available if you are a super administrator and will allow you to add the IP address to all the blogs of your Dotclear installation.</p>
  <p>You can add IP addresses with a network mask to block or allow a range of IP addresses. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0</code> or the abbreviated form <code>127/8</code> will recognize all the IP addresses like <code>127.xxx.xxx.xxx</code></li>
    <li><code>127.0.0.0/255.255.0.0</code> or the abbreviated form <code>127.0/16</code> will recognize all the IP addresses like <code>127.0.xxx.xxx</code></li>
    <li><code>127.0.0.0/255.255.255.0</code> or the abbreviated form <code>127.0.0/24</code> will recognize all the IP addresses like <code>127.0.0.xxx</code></li>
  </ul>
