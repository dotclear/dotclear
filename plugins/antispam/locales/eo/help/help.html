  <h4>Antispam</h4>
  <p>Spam in comments and trackbacks went from an anecdotic issue to a massive problem. Nowadays, it is mandatory to have a set of filters to check if a comment is potentially a junk or not. This is the purpose of the Antispam plugin.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Information</dt>
    <dd>The <strong>Junk comments</strong> link will take you to a list of all the junk comments (you will be able to run batch actions on junk comments in this page).</dd>
    <dd>The <strong>Published comments</strong> link will take you to a list of all published comments (you will be able to run batch actions in this page).</dd>
    <dd>The <strong>Delete all spams</strong> button will remove all spam messages at once.</dd>
    <dt>Available spam filters</dt>
    <dd>By default, Dotclear comes with 6 filters, including 2 deactivated filters. You can add more later on.</dd>
    <dd><strong>Order:</strong> Filters are applied from top to bottom. You can modify the filters order. Note that some default filters (<strong>IP Lookup</strong>, <strong>Links Lookup</strong> and <strong>Akismet</strong>) require access to the Netowrk and therefore can take some time. It is better to leave them towards the end of the list. In addition, the <strong>IP Filter</strong> filter decides which messages are not spam, so it's better to leave it at the top of the list.</dd>
    <dd><strong>Active:</strong> Check the box to activate a filter, uncheck it to deactivate it.</dd>
    <dd><strong>Auto Del.:</strong> If this box is checked, the messages considered as junk by this filter will be automatically deleted without any chance to make sure it was not a false positive.</dd>
    <dd><strong>Filter configuration:</strong> Some filters can (and, in some cases, must) be configured to be efficient. Click on this icon to access the configuration page of the filter.</dd>
