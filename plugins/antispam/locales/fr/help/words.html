	<dd>Similarly to IP addresses filtering, simply add the word you would like to filter. You can also, if you have the right permissions, define global words that will be used for all the blogs in your Dotclear installation.</dd> 
	<dd>Hint: You can add a regular expression to your words list by adding a <code>/</code> at the beginning and the end of the word. For instance, <code>/foo/</code> will filter all the words containing <em>foo</em>.</dd>
