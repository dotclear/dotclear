    <dt>Fair Trackbacks</dt>
    <dd>This filter checks if entering trackbacks contain a link to your entry. If it is not the case, they will be automatically banned, which means they won't appear in the list of junk comments.</dd>
    <dt>Links Lookup</dt>
    <dd>This filter works a bit like <strong>IP Lookup</strong> except that instead of checking the author's IP address, it will check the links contained in the comment (including the author's website) appear in the <a href="http://www.surbl.org/">URI reputation website SURBL</a>. This filter cannot be configured.</dd>
