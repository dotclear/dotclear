<h4>Use of widgets</h4>

<p>Widgets may be used to add various blocks of content to be displayed on your public pages. To add a widget, drag it from the <strong>Available widgets</strong> list on the left to one of the sidebars on the right of this page. You can order your widgets in a sidebar by dragging them up or down. To apply your changes, press <strong>Update sidebars</strong>.</p>

<p>Once included in a sidebar, widgets have configuration options that you can reach by clicking on the arrow next to their name.</p>

<p>To remove a widget, simply drag it to one of the dedicated zones</p>

<p>Remember to save your changes after any modification by pressing <strong>Update sidebars</strong></p>

<p>Use the <strong>Reset sidebars</strong> button to reset the sidebars as they were originally set in your system (a pop-up will ask you to confirm your choice).</p>

<h4>Widget Tags</h4>

<div id="widgets-tpl">

<p>If you are allowed to edit your theme templates, you can directly add widgets as templates tags, with their own configuration.</p>

<p>To add a widget in your template, you need to write code like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;tpl:Widget id="<strong>Widget ID</strong>"&gt;
  &lt;setting name="<strong>Setting name</strong>"&gt;<strong>Setting value</strong>&lt;/setting&gt;
  ...
&lt;/tpl:Widget&gt;
</pre>
